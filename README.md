# That's Your  Lot!

This was an experimental side-project at work when I had just learnt how to build flask apps and was getting into AI/ML (July 2019)

The plan for the project was to build carparking system for work that used security camera footage of carparks to count cars in the carpark.

I knew nothing about AI really at this stage, and used a package that wrapped resnets and yolo h5 models in very simple code.

I got a job in AI&Data at a different company at the time while I was still building the concept and so never finished the app, just putting together some basic components for the UI, repurposing code from the microblog flask tutorial.
